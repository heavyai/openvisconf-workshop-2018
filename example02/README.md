# Example 02: Rendering a Chart Using MapD3

Here we'll use data retrieved using mapd-connector to render a line chart
with the [mapd3](https://github.com/mapd/mapd3) library,
an open source charting library that uses [D3JS](https://github.com/d3).

To run this example do:

```
npm run example02
```
