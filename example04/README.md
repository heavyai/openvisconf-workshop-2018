# Example 04: Using MapD Crossfilter and MapD Charting

In this example we will use `mapd-charting` and `mapd-crossfilter` with our database
to create a few charts that can crossfilter one another.

**NOTE: this example is not yet working with Parcel.JS, we are working on fixing it**

_You may however use the examples in the [mapd-charting Github repository](https://github.com/mapd/mapd-charting/tree/master/example)_
